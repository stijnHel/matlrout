# matlrout
A set of matlab functions for "generic use".

## history
This set of code is started when using Matlab 4.2 ("_some time ago_").  Functions that were regarded as generic were put in this directory.
Some of these functions are "quite outdated".  Although some clean-up has been done, probably a lot can be thrown away.
Some of the functions added functionality that was not available in the version that was used.  A lot has been added, but the functions were kept (because (1) these functions are used and (2) I like "my way of working").

I use these functions as if they are standard Matlab.  Therefore I decided (finally) to make these functions publically available (not thinking that they will be generically used), mainly to have them available when I'm working on other ocmputers.
